This is the backend of NUS-Forum.

Note: this is the production branch that is deployed on heroku, so you can open the frontend of the app from https://nus-forum.netlify.app

Also note that the development branch uses sqlite, but the production branch uses postgresql.

To see the code for the development version, switch to the main branch.
